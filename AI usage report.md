AI Usage Report: ADmyBRAND Insights Analytics Dashboard
This project showcases a rapid, AI-assisted development workflow using a combination of Bolt.new for frontend generation and Augment Code for backend logic and data simulation. My main focus was delivering a visually modern, fully responsive analytics dashboard for “ADmyBRAND Insights” with extensive interactivity and component reusability.

Tools Used:
Bolt.new was my primary tool for rapidly scaffolding the React/Next.js frontend, generating reusable UI components, and establishing the overall design system. I used it to create the layout, overview metric cards, detailed chart sections, a sortable/filterable data table, and a floating pill-style navbar. Bolt.new’s ability to interpret detailed, chunked prompts made it easy to achieve precise designs while maintaining consistent spacing, theme toggling, and micro-interactions.

Augment Code was leveraged for generating backend endpoints to simulate real-time analytics metrics. I used it to set up REST APIs that provided dynamically updating mock data for the frontend to periodically fetch, enabling features like live metric cards, table updates, and export functionality (CSV/PDF). Its integration allowed me to focus on frontend polish, trusting the backend to respond with realistic, varied data.

Key Prompts:
Generate a responsive Next.js dashboard page for ‘ADmyBRAND Insights’ using a modern UI library. At the top, display four overview metric cards with icons, big numbers, labels, and subtle animation on hover. Ensure 8px spacing and light/dark mode support.

Create sections with line, bar, and donut charts using mock data, and enhance charts with smooth animations and interactive tooltips.

Add a data table for recent campaigns with sorting, filtering, pagination, and loading skeletons.

Simulate real-time updates by fetching new metric data every 5 seconds, provide export functionality, and organize the codebase into fully reusable components.

Workflow & AI/Manual Split
AI tools generated roughly 65% of the foundational code (major components, base hooks, mock data handling, and boilerplate). I focused my manual effort on customizing styling for brand consistency, optimizing layouts for responsiveness and accessibility, refining real-time logic, and ensuring a premium user experience with finely-tuned animations and interactivity. This blend of AI acceleration and thoughtful manual adjustments enabled delivery of a beautifully executed,

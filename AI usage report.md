# AI Usage Report: ADmyBRAND Insights Analytics Dashboard

This project showcases a rapid, AI-assisted development workflow using a combination of **Bolt.new** for frontend generation and **Augment Code** for backend logic and data simulation. My main focus was delivering a **visually modern**, **fully responsive analytics dashboard** for _ADmyBRAND Insights_ with **extensive interactivity** and **component reusability**.

## Tools Used

### Bolt.new  
Bolt.new was my primary tool for rapidly scaffolding the **React/Next.js** frontend, generating reusable UI components, and establishing the overall design system. I used it to create:

- The layout  
- Overview metric cards  
- Detailed chart sections  
- Sortable/filterable data table  
- Floating pill-style navbar  

Bolt.new’s ability to interpret detailed, chunked prompts made it easy to achieve precise designs while maintaining **consistent spacing**, **theme toggling**, and **micro-interactions**.

### Augment Code  
Augment Code was leveraged for generating **backend endpoints** to simulate **real-time analytics metrics**. I used it to set up REST APIs that provided dynamically updating **mock data** for the frontend to periodically fetch. This enabled:

- Live metric cards  
- Table updates  
- Export functionality (CSV/PDF)  

Its integration allowed me to focus on frontend polish, trusting the backend to respond with **realistic, varied data**.

## Key Prompts

- _Generate a responsive Next.js dashboard page for ‘ADmyBRAND Insights’ using a modern UI library. At the top, display four overview metric cards with icons, big numbers, labels, and subtle animation on hover. Ensure 8px spacing and light/dark mode support._

- _Create sections with line, bar, and donut charts using mock data, and enhance charts with smooth animations and interactive tooltips._

- _Add a data table for recent campaigns with sorting, filtering, pagination, and loading skeletons._

- _Simulate real-time updates by fetching new metric data every 5 seconds, provide export functionality, and organize the codebase into fully reusable components._

## Workflow & AI/Manual Split

AI tools generated roughly **65%** of the foundational code:

- Major components  
- Base hooks  
- Mock data handling  
- Boilerplate  

I focused my manual effort on customizing styling for **brand consistency**, optimizing **layouts for responsiveness and accessibility**, refining **real-time logic**, and ensuring a **premium user experience** with finely-tuned **animations and interactivity**. This blend of AI acceleration and thoughtful manual adjustments enabled delivery of a **beautifully executed, production-ready dashboard** in record time.
